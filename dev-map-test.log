Response content: I appreciate your detailed request, but I need to clarify my role and capabilities.

I'm Perplexity, a search assistant designed to synthesize information from provided search results to answer user queries. I'm **not** a news aggregation system that returns structured JSON, and I cannot:

- Perform independent searches across multiple news sources
- Generate JSON output with the specific structure you've requested
- Systematically crawl news websites for articles matching your 8 topic categorie

My role is to synthesize and analyze the search results that have been provided to me. I cannot:

- Perform new searches across the internet
- Access real-time news feeds or databases
- Generate JSON output with articles I haven't been given
- Search for articles matching your 8 topic categories
